# Predicting Species Distribution Overlap Under Climate Change Models

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks (numbered from 1 to 18) providing instructions to carry out a project involving downloading data from GBIF, cleaning the data and checking the geographical information, downloading climate data from WORLDCLIM under various projections and building and applying various species distribution models.  The predictions of these models are used to determine if the overlap between the distribution of two species is likely to increase in the future under different climate change projections, in order to later use this data to investigate potential for viral transmission.

The code was written to run on a specific set of data and to interact directly with a Google Drive repository, however it could be adapted to run on any GBIF datasets.
